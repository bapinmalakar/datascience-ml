ML algorithm types: 

1. Supervised learning: Going to teach computer how to do task
2. Unsupervised learning: Computer going to learn by self

Other type:
1. Reinforcement Learning
2. Recommender System

#Superviser Learning
Regression Problem: Try to find output of contiguous values  ex: price of hose
Classification Problem: Tyr to find output of Discrete Values(0 or 1) ex: Movie Like or Not, child class indentification

#Unsupervised Learning
1. Data are not labeld
2. We dont explained what each data point
3. We give data set, and ml try to find the structure of the data
4. In unsupervised we give data in different cluster, and ml try to predict the data into the different cluster
5. Known as Clustering algorithm
6. Google News use Cluster algorithom
7. Cluster Algorithm try to group the data, each group known as cluster

#Regression Problem with LinerRegression with Single X 
1. have training set
2. training set apply on learning algoritnm
3. Learning algorithm use h:function(hypothesis function) to predict traget(Y) and iput is features(X)
4. h(x) = Q0 + Q1(X),   Q0 is theta 0 and Q1 is theta 1, h(x) is linear function
5. Cost function: figure out best straight line into our data
6. Q0, Q1 are parameter
7. theta value may be (Q0, Q1) = (1.5, 0), (Q0, Q1) = (0, 0.5), (Q0, Q1) = (1, 0.5) 
8. now objective is findout the best parameter value
9. Choose the value of Q1,Q2 such taht h(x) give value near to Y of training data(X,Y)
10. Minimize Q0, Q1 such that h(x)-Y Square difference is minimum
11. Sum of (hi(x) - Y(i)) Square difference, i from 1 to n, where n is number of row(traing data size), let whole thing is T
12. So h(xi) = Q0 + Q1(xi),
13. Cost function is J(Q0, Q1) = (1/2N)(T)
14. This cost function is also known as Square Error Function

#Gradien Descent Algoritm
1. Use to find the value of Q1, Q2
2. And it will automatically find the best value
#Process
1. start with any value of Q0,Q1
2. Keep chnging value and evalute cost function J(Q0,Q1)
3. Stop when minimize the value of cost function J(Q0,Q1)

# Regression with multiple X
1. if i want to find y(roam price) using N-number of x (features i.e size, location, roam number, floor number etc), then I need to use Metrics and Vector
2. metric is a N dimensional(N= number of features) array, have all the fetures data
3. vetor is 1D array, have all target value respect to feaures

#Vector is a metrix with one column only (N X 1)
#Here this vector is N -Dimesional

#Predictin Formula
prediction = DataMetrics(metrics by X values) * Parameter Vector

#if X is more than 1 then
1. h(x) = Q0 + Q1(X1) + Q2(X2) + Q3(X3) + .... + QN(XN)
2. Each row is one columne


#Normal equation
Gradient Descent algorithm used to find Q, but this process is iterative proces. Fast even N is large, Need learning rate
We have another algorithm for find Q is Normal Equation by analytically, Slow if N is large, not required learning rate

#Classification Using Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is binary Classification model, because it can classify only two class. In Logistic Regression it ensure that 
the output of (hQ) should be 0<=h(Q1)<=1
1. h(X) = g(Q^T X)
2. g(z) = 1/(1+e^-z), z is row number and this function known as sigmoid functio/logistic function
3. z is -inifinity, g(z) approach to 0, z is +inifinity then g(z) approach to 1
4. Decision Boundary
5. the line beteween Y=0 class and Y=1 class, means the line which divided class 0 and 1, known as decision boundary
6. Incase of linear data this line is straight line
7. incase of non-liner boundary decision line can any form, curve, circle etc.
7. For no-linear data we can use polynomial regression like used in linear regression

#Validation or Evalute model
1. Used diffirent model on same data and check Error and select model which give less error
2. Divide same data for train, cross validation and test, 
3. then select model which give less cross validation error and apply test on this model
4. Then check Cross Validation error and Test error(May be Square error, MAE etc.)
5. If test error is high and Cross validation error is high, then underfit/bias
6. If test error is low and Cross validation error is higher then test error, then overfit/variance

#Unsupervised Learning(Cluster)
1. Here we dont have label in our data
2. We give data to the model and tell to find structure of the data
3. And then group the data based on structure or features
4. Each group known as cluster
5. KMeans algorithm is most popular widely used algorithm for clusterig


#Steps of KMeans
It have 2 loop
One for assign data point to closes cluster
And another loop to find centroind point of clusters
1. Define K, number of cluster we want
2. KMeans randomly initialize the centroid for eack cluster K
3. Iterate each data and assign each data to nearest cluster by distance beteween Data and cluster
    a. c = Xi - d(Ck), Xi  data point of row i and Ck is Kth cluster
    b. do this for all cluster(k) with same data
    c. Select cluster which one produce minimum difference
4. Repeat process 3 for all data(m)
5. Calculate centroid point for each cluster
    a. taking the avarage of all data points belong to this cluster Ck = ((X1+X2+X3+X4)/4)
    b. reinit the cluster with new mean value(new centroid)
6. Repeat step 2,3,4,5 until no change of centroid  point of each cluster

KMeans cost function also known as Distortion Algorithm

#Incase of random initialize of K
1. k<m, m number of training data
2. Randomly pick k training example
